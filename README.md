This data is exposed through the new endpoint "/d/data", providing detailed server information like version, uptime, memory usage, CPU usage, disk space, and network stats.

2. **Enhanced User Tracking**: User connections are now tracked using a Set to manage online users and display the total unique online users each time a connection is made.

3. **Improved Error Handling**: Error handling has been enhanced with specific error responses for 404 and 500 status codes. Additionally, error logging and response messages are implemented to provide better feedback to clients.

4. **Security Enhancements**: Password protection has received an update to allow for multiple authentication mechanisms based on configuration. The code now supports both custom username-password authentication and basic authentication using stored user credentials.

5. **Code Refactoring and Clean-up**: The codebase has undergone refactoring for better readability and maintainability. New modules like 'os' and 'util' are imported for system-related functionalities, and deprecated modules are removed. The updated code showcases a more organized and efficient structure.
